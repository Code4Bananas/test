# Google Maps API

#HTTParty connects to openweathermap.org

This is a ruby on Rails App that uses Google Maps API to pin-point General Assembly address on Broadway. I used the HTTParty gem to connect to openweathermap.org to pull in the current weather of Santa Monica.

####Learning Objectives
* Use HTTParty gem to pull in live weather content!
* Use google maps api to pin point with the classic red balloon mark!

* Present data in a meanigful way


I made this app at the WDI program in week 7!
