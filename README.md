# Where is General Assembly? - Ruby on Rails App

# Google Maps API

#HTTParty connects to openweathermap.org

This is a ruby on Rails App that uses Google Maps API to pin-point General Assembly address on Broadway. I used the HTTParty gem to connect to openweathermap.org to pull in the current weather of Santa Monica.

I made this app at the WDI program in week 7!
